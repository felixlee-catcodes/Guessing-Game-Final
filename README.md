Here is how the guessing-game operates:

A number between 1-100 will be randomly generated and is the winning number.
The player inputs their guess in a text input field and then submits their guess.
If the number submitted is the winning number, the player wins. Otherwise, they are allowed to try again.
The game should give the player a hint after each guess, helping them know whether to guess lower or higher and how close they are.
After five unsuccessful guesses, the game is over, and the player loses.
